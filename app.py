st.markdown("Remember that people can be inconsistent when it comes to sentiment analysis, and machine approaches  "
            "are no different. We also need to consider the domain under which words are used. For example, typically  "
            "the word 'bias' should be considered negative. But for kpop, and fandoms in general, bias instead means  "
            "the member you favor the most in a group. This explains why the sentiment for 'bias' is roughly evenly  "
            "split. The word 'bias' is usually found with other positive words, but if it stands on its own, it will  "
            "make a statement negative.")
st.markdown("From the sentiment analysis, to the topic modeling, to the text summarization, all of these analyses  "
            "were done with baseline tools. In the near future, I would like to use more cutting edge solutions to  "
            "get more accurate results. However, the quality of data is important as well. Since social media texts  "
            "are inherently very messy, it's possible that baseline methods would've worked well, but got hampered by  "
            "noise. Most of these concerns would be resolved if, for example, people used correct syntax and grammar  "
            "on YouTube.")
